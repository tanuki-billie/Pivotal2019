  levelDescription: '"Wait up!" That''s what kids say. They don''t say "wait", they
    say "Wait up! Hey, wait up!" ''Cause when you''re little, your life is up. The
    future is up. Everything you want is up. "Wait up! Hold up! Shut up! Mom, I''ll
    clean up! Let me stay up!" Parents of course are just the opposite. Everything
    is down. "Just calm down. Slow down. Come down here. Sit down. Put that down."
    - Jerry Seinfeld'
