# Pivotal (2019 outdated version)

This is an older version of Pivotal that was being worked on in 2019-early 2020. This was an initial prototype that I wanted to work on before I got dissuaded with the work I was doing and decided to scrap it (at least until 2021). I don't really have any use for this anymore, as I've since restarted the project multiple times, so I'm opening the code of this version to anybody interested.

Originally, the project was mostly me with a few collaborators who helped with some small art details, but since these art assets weren't used in any capacity, and these other contributors are no longer working on the project anymore, I've taken the liberty of removing their contributions (which, in all honesty, wasn't much). That should me

I won't be offering a playable version of this project, but if you're interested, [here's the latest version](https://tanuki-billie.itch.io/pivotal).

Have fun! - Billie
