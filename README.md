# Pivotal (2019 outdated version)

This is an older version of Pivotal that was being worked on in 2019-early 2020. This was an initial prototype that I wanted to work on before I got dissuaded with the work I was doing and decided to scrap it (at least until 2021).

Originally, the project was mostly me with a few collaborators who helped with some small art details, but since these art details are not used and they are no longer working on the project anymore, I've taken the liberty of removing their contributions (which, in all honesty, wasn't much). I encourage you to look around the project if you like, and see what I had in mind before I worked on a new version in 2021 for a game jam.

I won't be offering a playable version of this project, but if you're interested, [here's the latest version](https://billymyers.itch.io/pivotal).

Have fun! - Billy
